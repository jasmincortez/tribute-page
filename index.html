        <ul>
          <li><strong>1808</strong> - Founded by King John VI of Portugal.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1820</strong> - The 1820s were fundamental in the Botanical Garden of Rio de Janeiro due to its
            direction having been entrusted to Friar Leandro do Sacramento, one of the most important figures of science
            in Brazil at the time. His respectability was important for the Botanical Garden to gain the status of a
            reference institution among foreign scientists seeking knowledge about the Brazilian flora.
          </li>
          <strong>1822</strong> - The garden was opened to the public, and is now open during daylight hours every day
          except 25 December and 1 January.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1829</strong> - After the death of Friar Leandro in 1829, his disciple Bernardo Serpa Brandão took
            over the direction of the JBRJ, a position he held until 1851. He was responsible for the main symbol of the
            institution, a aléia das palmeiras (Roystonea oleracea).
          </li>
          <li>
          <li>
            <strong>1995</strong> - Changed its name to the Instituto de Pesquisas Jardim Botânico do Rio de Janeiro -
            linked to the Ministry of the Environment, being one of the most important research centers in the world in
            the areas of botany and biodiversity conservation to this day.
